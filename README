Win32-NTFS-Symlink
==================

The purpose of this module is to provide proper support for NTFS symlinks
and junctions on Windows, providing routines for creating and testing both,
and a common readlink routine capable of reading either one.

Further more, multiple methods for either importing or overriding the built-in
global function are provided, and nothing is imported or overridden by default.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

List::Util 1.45

(Test suite uses Test::More)

No non-core dependencies at this time.

EXTERNAL FILES

If you are using Windows XP, 2003 Server, and 2000 (any NT 5.x based Windows)
then a driver is needed to properly expose NTFS symlink support, so that it
can function in the same way as the natively exposed junctions do.

The driver, as well as it's source code, can be found here:
